# A1 Engine Search

This project is part of an assignment focusing on creating a search engine, a practical application of information retrieval in natural language processing (NLP). The search engine, deployed on a website, is designed to return the top paragraphs with the highest similarity to a given query, such as "Harry Potter." The project involves building upon existing code, implementing word embedding techniques, and creating a web interface for the search engine.
